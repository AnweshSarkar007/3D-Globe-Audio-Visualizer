# 3D-Globe-Audio-Visualizer
A browser-based 3D audio visualizer built with Three.js and the Web Audio API. This application transforms audio input—via live microphone or drag-and-drop file upload—into a stunning, real-time 3D experience. At its core is a dynamic wireframe sphere that distorts and pulses in sync with bass frequencies, rendered with a neon "Bloom".
