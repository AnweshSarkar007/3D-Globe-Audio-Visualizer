# 3D-Globe-Audio-Visualizer
A browser-based 3D audio visualizer built with Three.js and the Web Audio API. This application transforms audio input—via live microphone or drag-and-drop file upload—into a stunning, real-time 3D experience. At its core is a dynamic wireframe sphere that distorts and pulses in sync with bass frequencies, rendered with a neon "Bloom".

Features🎧 
Dual Audio Input:Live Microphone: Visualizes your voice or ambient music in real-time.
Drag & Drop Player: Drag any MP3/WAV file onto the screen to play it with perfect digital clarity.
Reactive 3D Geometry:Bass Response: The central sphere distorts and stretches based on low-frequency energy.
Starfield: Background stars rotate faster as the volume increases.Camera Shake: High-intensity bass drops trigger a physical camera shake effect.
Interactive Experience:Orbit Controls: Click and drag to rotate around the visualizer; scroll to zoom in/out.
Smart Dashboard: A floating UI controls sensitivity, color modes, and fullscreen toggles.
Auto-Hide: The dashboard vanishes automatically during fullscreen immersion.
Visual Effects:Bloom Post-Processing: Adds a neon "glow" to the wireframes.
Rainbow Mode: optional automatic color cycling.
